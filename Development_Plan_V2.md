# Mental Math App Expansion Plan
## Addition & Subtraction Facts + Progressive Number Sense Application

> **Purpose**: This document is a comprehensive implementation plan for Claude Code. It extends the existing mental math app (which covers multiplication/division facts and basic number sense) to include addition/subtraction fact fluency AND a progression system that takes users from foundational number sense all the way to solving multi-digit and word problems using selectable mental math strategies.

## 1. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Design Principles
- **ES6 Modular Architecture**: Each feature area is a separate JS module (100–150 lines max per file)
- **Incremental Mastery**: No topic unlocks until prerequisites are demonstrated
- **Show Your Working**: Every strategy/method displays all intermediate steps so the user can follow the logic
- **Diagnose Before Drill**: The app identifies *what* is misunderstood before prescribing practice
- **Multiple Strategies**: For any given problem, the user can see and select from multiple valid methods
- **Visual First**: Every concept has a pictorial/illustration mode for concrete understanding before abstract practice

### Integration with Existing App
This expansion sits alongside the existing multiplication/division and number sense modules. Shared systems:
- Adaptive difficulty engine (time + accuracy metrics)
- Firebase-compatible data layer with localStorage fallback
- Session logging and progress tracking
- Progress dashboard and stats view
- Colour-coded feedback system

---

## 2. MODULE A: ADDITION & SUBTRACTION FACTS

### 2.1 Scope
Mastery of all addition facts (0+0 through 12+12) and subtraction facts (0-0 through 24-12), with automatic inverse linking (if you know 7+5=12, you should know 12-5=7).

### 2.2 Strategy-Based Fact Families

Each fact is taught through a specific strategy. The app groups facts by the strategy used to derive them:

#### Addition Strategies (in teaching order)

| # | Strategy | Facts Covered | Example |
|---|----------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | **Counting On +1, +2, +3** | n+1, n+2, n+3 for all n | 7+2 → "start at 7, count 8, 9" |
| 2 | **Doubles** | n+n for n=0–12 | 6+6=12 |
| 3 | **Doubles +1 / -1** | n+n+1, n+n-1 | 6+7 → "6+6=12, plus 1 = 13" |
| 4 | **Doubles +2 / -2** | n+n+2, n+n-2 | 6+8 → "7+7=14" or "6+6=12, +2=14" |
| 5 | **Making 10** | Pairs that sum to 10 | 7+3=10, 8+2=10 |
| 6 | **Adding to 10 (Bridge through 10)** | Single digit + single digit crossing 10 | 8+5 → "8+2=10, 10+3=13" |
| 7 | **Commutative Swap** | If a+b is hard, try b+a | 3+9 → think "9+3" |
| 8 | **Adding 10** | n+10 for all n | 7+10=17 |
| 9 | **Adding 9 (add 10 subtract 1)** | n+9 for all n | 7+9 → "7+10=17, 17-1=16" |
| 10 | **Adding 0** | n+0 identity | 5+0=5 |

#### Subtraction Strategies (in teaching order)

| # | Strategy | Facts Covered | Example |
|---|----------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | **Counting Back -1, -2, -3** | n-1, n-2, n-3 | 9-2 → "9, 8, 7" |
| 2 | **Subtracting 0** | n-0 identity | 7-0=7 |
| 3 | **Think Addition (Inverse)** | All facts via a+?=b | 13-5 → "5+?=13, 5+8=13, so 8" |
| 4 | **Doubles Subtraction** | 2n - n = n | 14-7=7 (because 7+7=14) |
| 5 | **Subtract from 10** | 10-n for n=0–10 | 10-6=4 |
| 6 | **Bridge Back Through 10** | Teen number - single digit crossing 10 | 13-5 → "13-3=10, 10-2=8" |
| 7 | **Subtracting 10** | n-10 | 17-10=7 |
| 8 | **Subtracting 9 (subtract 10 add 1)** | n-9 | 16-9 → "16-10=6, 6+1=7" |
| 9 | **Compensation** | Adjust to easier number | 15-8 → "15-10=5, 5+2=7" |
| 10 | **Same Difference** | Adjust both numbers equally | 83-47 → "86-50=36" |

### 2.3 Fact Mastery Tracking

For each of the 169 addition facts (0–12 × 0–12) and corresponding subtraction facts:

```javascript
factMastery: {
  "7+5": {
    strategy: "bridge_through_10",
    attempts: 14,
    correct: 12,
    averageTimeMs: 2800,
    lastSeen: "2026-02-10",
    masteryLevel: "fluent",    // learning | developing | secure | fluent
    linkedFacts: ["5+7", "12-5", "12-7"],
    mistakeHistory: ["answered_11", "answered_11", "answered_13"]
  }
}
```

**Mastery Levels**:
- **Learning**: < 60% accuracy OR > 10s response time
- **Developing**: 60–79% accuracy OR 5–10s response time
- **Secure**: 80–94% accuracy AND 3–5s response time
- **Fluent**: 95%+ accuracy AND < 3s response time

### 2.4 Progression Rules

1. User starts a diagnostic quiz covering all strategy groups (5 questions each)
2. Results identify which strategies are already known vs need teaching
3. Strategies are taught in order — the user cannot skip ahead
4. A strategy is "complete" when 90% of its facts reach "Secure" or above
5. Periodic mixed review pulls from all learned strategies to maintain fluency
6. Inverse linking: if addition fact reaches "Fluent", automatically test the subtraction inverse

---

## 3. MODULE B: PROGRESSIVE NUMBER APPLICATION

### 3.1 Overview

This module takes the foundational facts and strategies from Module A (and the existing multiplication/division module) and applies them to progressively larger and more complex problems. The goal is to demonstrate that **big number arithmetic is just small number arithmetic applied systematically**.

### 3.2 Progression Levels

```
Level 1: Single-digit (1–9) ← Facts from Module A
Level 2: Two-digit ± single-digit (e.g. 34 + 7, 52 - 8)
Level 3: Two-digit ± two-digit (e.g. 47 + 35, 82 - 46)
Level 4: Three-digit ± two/three-digit (e.g. 347 + 256, 503 - 187)
Level 5: Four-digit and beyond (e.g. 4,372 + 1,859)
Level 6: Mixed operations and multi-step (e.g. 347 + 256 - 189)
Level 7: Word problems using any of the above
```

### 3.3 Mental Math Methods for Larger Numbers

Each method must display ALL intermediate steps. The user can select which method to use or see all of them.

#### METHOD 1: Partitioning (Place Value Split)
```
347 + 256
Step 1: Split into place values
        300 + 40 + 7
      + 200 + 50 + 6
Step 2: Add each column
        Hundreds: 300 + 200 = 500
        Tens:      40 +  50 =  90
        Ones:       7 +   6 =  13
Step 3: Recombine
        500 + 90 + 13 = 603
```

#### METHOD 2: Sequencing (Left to Right / Jump Strategy)
```
347 + 256
Step 1: Start with 347
Step 2: + 200 → 547     (add hundreds)
Step 3: + 50  → 597     (add tens)
Step 4: + 6   → 603     (add ones)
Answer: 603
```
Visual: Number line showing each jump.

#### METHOD 3: Compensation (Round and Adjust)
```
347 + 298
Step 1: 298 is close to 300
Step 2: 347 + 300 = 647  (easier sum)
Step 3: But we added 2 too many
Step 4: 647 - 2 = 645
Answer: 645
```

#### METHOD 4: Same Difference (for Subtraction)
```
503 - 187
Step 1: Add 13 to both numbers (to make subtrahend a round number)
Step 2: 516 - 200 = 316
Answer: 316
Why: The difference stays the same when you add/subtract the same amount from both
```

#### METHOD 5: Column Method (Traditional Written)
```
  347
+ 256
-----
Step 1: Ones: 7 + 6 = 13, write 3 carry 1
Step 2: Tens: 4 + 5 + 1(carry) = 10, write 0 carry 1
Step 3: Hundreds: 3 + 2 + 1(carry) = 6
Answer: 603
```

#### METHOD 6: Counting On (for small differences in subtraction)
```
503 - 496
Step 1: Count up from 496
        496 → 500 (+4)
        500 → 503 (+3)
Step 2: 4 + 3 = 7
Answer: 7
```

#### METHOD 7: Number Line / Bar Model
Visual representation of any of the above methods on a number line, showing the jumps, partitions, or adjustments as visual segments.

### 3.4 Method Selection UI

When presented with a problem, the user sees:
1. The problem (e.g. "347 + 256")
2. A "Choose your method" panel showing available methods as clickable cards
3. Each card shows a brief label and one-line description:
   - 🧩 **Partitioning** — "Split numbers by place value"
   - ➡️ **Sequencing** — "Add in steps from left to right"
   - 🔄 **Compensation** — "Round to an easier number, then adjust"
   - ⚖️ **Same Difference** — "Shift both numbers to make it easier"
   - 📝 **Column Method** — "Traditional written method"
   - 🔢 **Counting On** — "Count up from one number to the other"
4. After the user solves it, they can click "Show Other Methods" to see alternative approaches
5. A "Which was fastest?" reflection prompt encourages metacognition

### 3.5 Adaptive Method Recommendations

The app tracks which methods the user is most accurate/fastest with and:
- Suggests their strongest method for timed challenges
- Recommends practising weaker methods during training mode
- For each problem, highlights which method is typically most efficient (e.g. compensation for near-round numbers, counting on for close numbers)

## 4. TOP 10 MISUNDERSTANDINGS & MISTAKES

### 4.1 Addition — Top 10 Misunderstandings

| # | Misunderstanding | Example of Error | Root Cause | Diagnostic Question |
|---|-----------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Counting includes the start number** | 7+3: counts "7,8,9" → 9 instead of 10 | Doesn't understand "counting on" means starting AFTER | "Start at 7. Count on 3 more. What numbers do you say?" |
| 2 | **Place value confusion in carrying** | 47+35: writes 712 (7+5=12, 4+3=7) | Doesn't understand that the 1 in 12 represents 10, not 1 | "In the number 12, what does the 1 mean?" |
| 3 | **Always adds left to right without regrouping** | 48+37: gets 75 (4+3=7, 8+7=15, drop the 1) | Procedural error — forgets to carry or doesn't know when to | "What happens when ones add up to more than 9?" |
| 4 | **Doesn't understand commutativity** | Knows 9+3=12 but can't quickly solve 3+9 | Treats 3+9 as a different, unlearned fact | "Is 3+9 the same as 9+3? Why?" |
| 5 | **Adds digits independently across a number** | 23+45 → 2+4=6, 3+5=8, answer: 68 (correct by luck) but 27+45 → 2+4=6, 7+5=12 → 612 | Doesn't understand place value carrying | "What is 27+45? Show me your steps." |
| 6 | **Confuses addition with multiplication** | Sees 6+6 and answers 36 (thinking 6×6) | Strategy interference, especially after learning times tables | Mixed operation drill: "6+6=? 6×6=?" |
| 7 | **Bridge through 10 errors** | 8+5: "8+2=10, then...3? 4?" — loses track of remainder | Can split to 10 but loses the leftover part | "8+5: You need 2 to make 10. How many are left from the 5?" |
| 8 | **Zero misconception** | Thinks 5+0=0 or is unsure | Conflates "adding nothing" with "the answer is nothing" | "I have 5 sweets. I get 0 more. How many do I have?" |
| 9 | **Misaligns columns in written addition** | 347+52 written as 347+520 because digits aren't aligned right | Doesn't understand place value alignment | Show 347+52 written both correctly and incorrectly, ask which is right |
| 10 | **Overgeneralises compensation** | 45+28: rounds 28→30, does 45+30=75, then adds 2 instead of subtracting → 77 | Doesn't understand whether to add or subtract the adjustment | "You added 2 extra to 28 to make 30. Should you add or subtract 2 from the total? Why?" |

### 4.2 Subtraction — Top 10 Misunderstandings

| # | Misunderstanding | Example of Error | Root Cause | Diagnostic Question |
|---|-----------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Always subtracts smaller digit from larger** | 42-17: does 4-1=3, 7-2=5 → 35 | Doesn't understand regrouping/borrowing | "What is 42-17? Show steps." |
| 2 | **Borrowing confusion — forgets to reduce** | 503-287: borrows from 5 to make ones 13, but leaves the 5 as 5 | Procedural gap in multi-step borrowing | "After you borrow from the tens, what happens to the tens digit?" |
| 3 | **Borrowing across zero** | 400-156: can't borrow from 0 in tens column | Doesn't know to chain-borrow from hundreds through tens | "How do you borrow when the next column is 0?" |
| 4 | **Subtraction is not commutative but treats it as such** | Thinks 5-3 = 3-5 = 2 | Doesn't understand order matters | "Is 5-3 the same as 3-5?" |
| 5 | **Negative number confusion** | 3-7: writes 4 (reverses to 7-3) | Avoids negative results by swapping | "What is 3-7? Is it possible? What does it mean?" |
| 6 | **Counting back includes start number** | 10-3: counts "10, 9, 8" → 8 instead of 7 | Same counting error as addition | "Count back 3 from 10. What numbers do you say?" |
| 7 | **Subtracting from 10/100/1000 errors** | 1000-467: various errors in chain borrowing | Multiple conceptual gaps compounding | Staged: "10-7=? 100-67=? 1000-467=?" |
| 8 | **Think-addition fails when facts aren't fluent** | 15-8: tries "8+?=15" but can't recall, guesses | Addition fact fluency is a prerequisite | Test the inverse addition fact first |
| 9 | **Compensation direction reversed** | 63-29: does 63-30=33, then subtracts 1 → 32 instead of adding 1 | Confused about adjustment direction | "You subtracted 1 extra. Do you need to put it back or take more away?" |
| 10 | **Misreads subtraction as addition** | 74-38: answers 112 | Inattention or sign confusion, often in mixed operation drills | Highlight the operation sign. "What does this symbol tell you to do?" |

### 4.3 Larger Numbers — Top 10 Misunderstandings

| # | Misunderstanding | Example of Error | Root Cause | Diagnostic Question |
|---|-----------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Place value misunderstanding** | Thinks the 4 in 4,372 is worth 4, not 4,000 | Weak place value foundation | "What is the value of the 4 in 4,372?" |
| 2 | **Column misalignment** | Adds 4372+59 as 4372+5900 | Doesn't right-align numbers | "Where does the 59 go when you line it up under 4372?" |
| 3 | **Carrying across multiple columns** | 4,897+3,654: errors cascade across columns | Single carrying is OK but chaining fails | Two-column carry first, then three, then four |
| 4 | **Partitioning errors with big numbers** | 4,372 → "4+3+7+2" instead of "4000+300+70+2" | Place value not connected to partitioning | "Partition 4,372 into thousands, hundreds, tens and ones" |
| 5 | **Sequencing/jump errors with big numbers** | Gets lost in multi-step jumps on a number line | Working memory overload | Reduce number of jumps; write each step down |
| 6 | **Compensation adjustment size errors** | 2,997+1,456: rounds to 3,000 (adds 3) but adjusts by 30 or 300 | Confused about how much was added when rounding | "2,997 to 3,000 — how much did you add?" |
| 7 | **Reading/writing large numbers** | Reads 30,042 as "thirty thousand and forty-two" but writes it as 3042 | Disconnect between verbal and written forms | "Write 'thirty thousand and forty-two' as a number" |
| 8 | **Forgetting to include zeros as placeholders** | 4,000+300+2 = 432 instead of 4,302 | Drops the zero placeholder | "What goes in the tens place in 4,302?" |
| 9 | **Estimating before solving** | Can't tell if 347+256 should be roughly 600 | Doesn't use rounding as a reasonableness check | "Without calculating, roughly what should 347+256 be?" |
| 10 | **Choosing an inappropriate method** | Uses column method for 1000-1 (should be instant) or tries mental partitioning for 4,897+3,654 | Lack of method selection awareness | "What's the quickest way to solve this? Why?" |

// Error pattern matching rules
const errorPatterns = {
  "smaller_from_larger": {
    // User always subtracts smaller digit from larger regardless of position
    detect: (problem, userAnswer, correctAnswer) => {
      // e.g., 42-17: user answered 35 (4-1=3, 7-2=5)
      const digits = analyseDigitPairs(problem);
      return digits.every(([top, bottom]) =>

    },
    misunderstanding: "counting_includes_start",
    remediation: "counting_on_unit"
  },
  // ... more patterns
};
```

### 5.3 Remediation Unit Structure

Each remediation unit follows this sequence:

```
1. ILLUSTRATE: Visual/pictorial explanation of the concept
   - Concrete manipulatives (blocks, counters, number line)
   - Animation showing the concept step by step

2. EXPLAIN: Short, clear text explanation
   - Maximum 3 sentences
   - Highlights the specific misconception and corrects it
   - Uses "You might have thought X, but actually Y because Z"

3. GUIDED PRACTICE: Incremental sums with full working shown
   - Start with the simplest possible version of the concept
   - Each step builds ONE new element
   - User completes each sub-step individually
   - Immediate feedback with visual support

4. INDEPENDENT PRACTICE: Gradually remove scaffolding
   - Same problem types but without step-by-step breakdown
   - Still show intermediate steps in review if incorrect

5. CHECK: Re-assess the specific misunderstanding
   - 5 questions targeting exactly this misconception
   - Must achieve 80% to proceed
   - If failed, loop back to step 1 with different examples
```

### 5.4 Incremental Sum Breakdown Example

**Target**: User doesn't understand borrowing/regrouping in subtraction

```
Incremental Sequence:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 1: No borrowing needed
  "15 - 3 = ?"                    (ones subtraction, no borrow)

Step 2: Borrowing concept with manipulatives  
  [VISUAL: 1 ten-rod and 5 unit cubes]
  "You have 15. That's 1 ten and 5 ones."
  "Can you take 8 ones away from 5 ones?"
  → User answers No
  "Right! We need to break the ten into ones."
  [ANIMATION: ten-rod breaks into 10 unit cubes]
  "Now you have 0 tens and 15 ones. Take away 8."
  "15 - 8 = ?"

Step 3: Written form of what just happened
  "  15       →      0  15  "
  "- 8              -    8  "
  "----             ------  "
  "                     7   "
  "The 1 ten became 10 ones. 10+5=15 ones. 15-8=7."

Step 4: Two-digit minus one-digit WITH borrowing  
  "32 - 7 = ?"
  Sub-step A: "Can you take 7 from 2?"  → No
  Sub-step B: "Borrow 1 ten. Tens: 3→2. Ones: 2→12"
  Sub-step C: "12 - 7 = ?"  → 5
  Sub-step D: "Tens digit is now 2. Answer: 25"

Step 5: Two-digit minus two-digit WITH borrowing
  "42 - 17 = ?"
  Sub-step A: "Ones: 2-7. Can you do this?" → No
  Sub-step B: "Borrow. Tens: 4→3. Ones: 2→12"  
  Sub-step C: "12 - 7 = ?" → 5
  Sub-step D: "3 - 1 = ?" → 2
  Sub-step E: "Answer: 25"

Step 6: Same problem without sub-step prompts
  "53 - 28 = ?"
  (User enters 25. Correct!)

Step 7: Problem with carrying in addition for contrast
  "47 + 35 = ?"
  (Tests that borrowing knowledge hasn't broken addition understanding)
```

## 6. VISUAL & PICTORIAL ILLUSTRATION SYSTEM

### 6.1 Visual Types

Each concept has associated visuals. These are rendered using HTML5 Canvas or SVG, not external images.

| Visual Type | Used For | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Base-10 Blocks** | Place value, regrouping | Thousands cubes, hundreds flats, tens rods, ones units. Animate breaking/combining. |
| **Number Line** | Counting on/back, sequencing, jumps, compensation | Horizontal line with tick marks. Animated arcs showing jumps. Labels on each arc. |
| **Part-Whole Model** | Fact families, making 10, partitioning | Circle at top, two circles below. Shows how a number splits into parts. |
| **Bar Model** | Comparison, word problems, same difference | Rectangular bars of proportional length. Labelled sections. |
| **Ten Frames** | Making 10, number bonds, addition to 20 | 2×5 grid with filled/empty dots. |
| **Place Value Chart** | Column alignment, partitioning, carrying | Th | H | T | O columns with digits and arrows for carrying. |
| **Counters / Dots** | Concrete counting, grouping | Coloured circles that can be grouped, moved, crossed out. |
| **Balance Scale** | Equals sign meaning, commutativity, equations | Two pans showing equivalence. |

### 6.2 Implementation Approach

```javascript
// Visual component interface
class MathVisual {
  constructor(canvas, type, options) { }
  
  // Animate a step-by-step explanation
  async animateSteps(steps) { }
  
  // Render a static state
  render(state) { }
  
  // Allow user interaction (drag counters, draw on number line)
  enableInteraction(onComplete) { }
}

// Example: Number line for 347 + 256 using sequencing
const visual = new MathVisual(canvas, 'numberLine', {
  min: 300,
  max: 650,
  start: 347
});

await visual.animateSteps([
  { jump: 200, label: "+200", land: 547 },
  { jump: 50,  label: "+50",  land: 597 },
  { jump: 6,   label: "+6",   land: 603 }
]);
```

### 6.3 When Visuals Are Shown

- **Always** during remediation units (mandatory)
- **On request** during normal practice (tap "Show me" button)
- **Automatically** after 2 consecutive wrong answers on same concept
- **As celebration** — animated visual when mastering a strategy group

## 7. METHOD SELECTION & MULTI-STRATEGY SYSTEM

### 7.1 Core Feature: "Solve It Your Way"

For every problem at Level 2+ (two-digit and above), the app offers:

1. **Free Solve**: User solves it however they want, enters answer
2. **Choose a Method**: User picks from available method cards, then the app guides them through that method's steps
3. **Show All Methods**: After solving, user can tap to see how the problem would be solved by every applicable method
4. **Compare Methods**: Side-by-side view showing the same problem solved 2–3 different ways, with step counts and a "Which do you prefer?" prompt

### 7.2 Method Applicability Rules

Not every method suits every problem. The app determines which methods to offer:

```javascript
const methodApplicability = {
  partitioning: {
    operations: ['addition', 'subtraction'],
    minDigits: 2,
    maxDigits: 5,
    bestWhen: 'general purpose, no rounding needed'
  },
  sequencing: {
    operations: ['addition', 'subtraction'],
    minDigits: 2,
    maxDigits: 4,
    bestWhen: 'one number is much smaller or simpler'
  },
  compensation: {
    operations: ['addition', 'subtraction'],
    minDigits: 2,
    maxDigits: 5,
    bestWhen: (a, b) => nearRoundNumber(a) || nearRoundNumber(b),
    // e.g., 298, 499, 1001
  },
  sameDifference: {
    operations: ['subtraction'],
    minDigits: 2,
    maxDigits: 5,
    bestWhen: (a, b) => nearRoundNumber(b),
    // Makes subtrahend a round number
  },
  columnMethod: {
    operations: ['addition', 'subtraction'],
    minDigits: 2,
    maxDigits: 99,
    bestWhen: 'always available as written fallback'
  },
  countingOn: {
    operations: ['subtraction'],
    minDigits: 2,
    maxDigits: 4,
    bestWhen: (a, b) => Math.abs(a - b) < 20,
    // Numbers are close together
  }
};
```

### 7.3 Method Mastery Tracking

```javascript
methodMastery: {
  "partitioning": {
    timesUsed: 24,
    accuracy: 0.88,
    avgTimeMs: 14000,
    comfortLevel: "confident",  // novice | practising | confident | expert
    lastUsed: "2026-02-10"
  },
  // ... for each method
}
```

### 7.4 "Method of the Day" Feature

Each practice session introduces or highlights one method. The app:
1. Explains the method with a visual example
2. Gives 5 guided practice problems using that method
3. Gives 5 independent practice problems
4. Shows how the same problems could be solved with a previously learned method
5. Asks the user to reflect: "Which method did you find easier for these problems?"

---

## 8. INTERMEDIATE STEP DISPLAY SYSTEM

### 8.1 Core Requirement

**Every method MUST show all intermediate steps so the user never wonders "where did that number come from?"**

### 8.2 Step Display Format

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  347 + 256                          │
│                                     │
│  Method: Partitioning               │
│  ─────────────────                  │
│                                     │
│  Step 1 of 3: Split into place      │
│  values                             │
│  ┌───────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ 347 = 300 + 40 + 7           │  │

│  ┌───────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ 500 + 90 + 13 = 603          │  │
│  │ (Note: 90 + 13 = 103,        │  │
│  │  then 500 + 103 = 603)       │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────┘  │
│                                     │
│  ✅ Answer: 603                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 8.3 Interactive Steps Mode

In "Choose a Method" mode, the user is prompted to complete each sub-step:

```
Step 1: Split 347 into place values
  Hundreds: [____]  (user types 300)  ✅
  Tens:     [____]  (user types 40)   ✅
  Ones:     [____]  (user types 7)    ✅

Step 2: Now split 256
  Hundreds: [____]  (user types 200)  ✅
  Tens:     [____]  (user types 50)   ✅
  Ones:     [____]  (user types 6)    ✅

Step 3: Add the hundreds
  300 + 200 = [____]  (user types 500)  ✅

Step 4: Add the tens
  40 + 50 = [____]  (user types 90)  ✅

Step 5: Add the ones
  7 + 6 = [____]  (user types 13)  ✅

Step 6: Combine all parts
  500 + 90 + 13 = [____]  (user types 603)  ✅

🎉 Correct! Well done!
```

If the user gets a sub-step wrong, the app provides immediate correction with a mini-visual before continuing.

## 9. WORD PROBLEM ENGINE

### 9.1 Problem Categories

| Category | Example | Key Skill |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Join (Result Unknown)** | "Sam had 347 stickers. He got 256 more. How many now?" | Addition |
| **Separate (Result Unknown)** | "A shop had 503 apples. 187 were sold. How many left?" | Subtraction |
| **Join (Change Unknown)** | "Mia had 245 beads. After buying more, she had 512. How many did she buy?" | Subtraction (to find difference) |
| **Separate (Start Unknown)** | "Some children were on a bus. 28 got off. Now there are 34. How many were on at first?" | Addition (reverse thinking) |
| **Compare (Difference)** | "Class A raised £472. Class B raised £319. How much more did Class A raise?" | Subtraction |
| **Compare (Bigger Unknown)** | "Tom has 156 cards. He has 89 more than Amy. How many does Amy have?" | Subtraction |
| **Multi-Step** | "A school had 1,250 books. They bought 350 more and then gave 175 to charity. How many now?" | Mixed operations |
| **Estimation First** | "About how many people visited the museum if 2,847 came on Saturday and 3,215 on Sunday?" | Rounding + Addition |

### 9.2 Word Problem Scaffolding

For each word problem, the app provides layered scaffolding (shown on request or after errors):

**Level 1 — Highlight Key Information**
- Numbers highlighted in blue
- Operation keywords highlighted in green ("more", "left", "difference", "total")
- Question highlighted in yellow

**Level 2 — Bar Model Representation**
- Auto-generate a bar model diagram from the problem
- User labels the parts of the bar model

**Level 3 — Write the Number Sentence**
- User translates the word problem into a number sentence (e.g. "503 - 187 = ?")
- App verifies the number sentence before the user solves it

**Level 4 — Solve with Chosen Method**
- User picks a method and solves with full intermediate steps

### 9.3 Word Problem Generation

```javascript
const wordProblemTemplates = {
  join_result_unknown: [
    "{name} had {n1} {object}. {pronoun} {verb_got} {n2} more. How many {object} does {name} have now?",
    "There were {n1} {object} in the {place}. {n2} more were {verb_added}. How many are there now?",
    "In the morning, {n1} {object} were {verb_counted}. By afternoon, {n2} more {verb_arrived}. What is the total?"
  ],
  // ... templates for each category
};

// Context themes to keep problems engaging
const themes = [
  { object: "stickers", place: "collection", names: ["Sam", "Aisha", "Leo"] },
  { object: "books", place: "library", names: ["Mrs Chen", "Mr Patel"] },
  { object: "steps", place: "walk to school", names: ["the children"] },
  { object: "points", place: "game", names: ["Team Red", "Team Blue"] },
  // ... many more
];
```

### 9.4 Word Problem Misunderstanding Detection

Common word problem mistakes to detect:
1. **Picks wrong operation** — adds when should subtract (or vice versa)
2. **Ignores part of a multi-step problem** — only does one operation
3. **Reverses the comparison** — finds "how many more A than B" but gives B's count
4. **Treats "how many more" as addition** — common keyword trap
5. **Cannot extract numbers from context** — overwhelmed by text

Detection: The app asks the user to first write the number sentence. If the number sentence is wrong, remediation targets comprehension, not calculation.

## 10. DATA MODEL & PROGRESSION LOGIC

### 10.1 User Progress Data Structure

```javascript
const userProgress = {
  // Module A: Facts
  additionFacts: {
    strategyGroups: {
      counting_on: { status: "mastered", unlockedAt: "2026-01-15" },
      doubles: { status: "practising", percentComplete: 72 },
      making_10: { status: "locked" },
      // ...
    },
    individualFacts: { /* per-fact mastery as in section 2.3 */ },
    overallAccuracy: 0.84,
    overallFluency: 0.61,  // % of facts at "fluent" level
  },
  subtractionFacts: { /* mirror structure */ },
  
  // Module B: Progressive Application
  progressiveLevels: {
    level2_2d_1d: { status: "mastered", bestMethods: ["sequencing", "compensation"] },
    level3_2d_2d: { status: "practising", percentComplete: 55 },
    level4_3d: { status: "locked" },
    level5_4d_plus: { status: "locked" },
    level6_mixed: { status: "locked" },
    level7_word_problems: { status: "locked" },
  },
  
  // Method proficiency
  methods: { /* as in section 7.3 */ },
  
  // Misunderstandings
  diagnostics: {
    identified: [
      {
        id: "always_subtracts_smaller_from_larger",
        detectedAt: "2026-02-01",
        remediationStatus: "in_progress",  // identified | in_progress | resolved
        remediationAttempts: 2,
        lastAttemptScore: 0.6
      }
    ],
    resolved: [ /* previously fixed misunderstandings */ ]
  },
  
  // Session history
  sessions: [
    {
      date: "2026-02-10",
      module: "addition_facts",
      duration: 480,  // seconds
      questionsAttempted: 25,
      correct: 21,
      strategies: { "doubles": 8, "making_10": 10, "bridge_10": 7 }
    }
  ]
};
```

### 10.2 Unlock Logic

```javascript
const unlockRules = {
  // Module A prerequisites
  "doubles_strategy":       () => strategyMastered("counting_on"),
  "doubles_plus_1":         () => strategyMastered("doubles"),
  "making_10":              () => strategyMastered("doubles"),
  "bridge_through_10":      () => strategyMastered("making_10"),
  
  // Module B prerequisites
  "level2_2d_1d":           () => additionFactsFluency() > 0.70 && subtractionFactsFluency() > 0.60,
  "level3_2d_2d":           () => levelMastered("level2_2d_1d"),
  "level4_3d":              () => levelMastered("level3_2d_2d"),
  "level5_4d_plus":         () => levelMastered("level4_3d"),
  "level6_mixed":           () => levelMastered("level4_3d"),
  "level7_word_problems":   () => levelMastered("level3_2d_2d"),  // Can start word problems earlier
  
  // Methods — all methods available from Level 2 onwards, but:
  "compensation":           () => strategyMastered("making_10") && strategyMastered("adding_9"),
  "same_difference":        () => methodConfident("compensation"),
};
```

### 10.3 Adaptive Difficulty Within Each Level

```javascript
function selectNextProblem(level, userHistory) {
  // 1. If misunderstandings are active, prioritise remediation
  if (activeMisunderstandings.length > 0) {
    return generateRemediationProblem(activeMisunderstandings[0]);
  }
  
  // 2. Spaced repetition: bring back previously struggled facts/problems
  const dueForReview = getSpacedRepetitionDue(userHistory);
  if (dueForReview.length > 0 && Math.random() < 0.3) {
    return dueForReview[0];
  }
  
  // 3. New material at the edge of the user's ability
  // - If last 5 questions were all correct and fast: increase difficulty
  // - If last 5 questions had 2+ errors: decrease difficulty
  // - Otherwise: stay at current difficulty
  const recentPerformance = userHistory.slice(-5);
  const difficulty = adjustDifficulty(recentPerformance, level);
  
  return generateProblem(level, difficulty);
}
```

## APPENDIX A: EXAMPLE REMEDIATION SEQUENCES

### A.1 Remediation: "Always Subtracts Smaller from Larger"

```
ILLUSTRATE:
  [Visual: Two bars. Top bar: 42 (split into 40 and 2). Bottom bar: 17 (split into 10 and 7)]
  "Look at 42 - 17. In the ones column, we need to take 7 from 2."
  "But 2 is smaller than 7! We can't just swap them."
  
  [Animation: The 40 breaks — one ten moves to the ones column]
  "We borrow a ten from the 40. Now we have 30 and 12."
  "12 - 7 = 5. Then 30 - 10 = 20. Answer: 25."

EXPLAIN:
  "When the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit, you must borrow (regroup) from
   the next column. You CANNOT just subtract the smaller from the larger — that gives a
   wrong answer."

GUIDED PRACTICE (Incremental):
  1. "13 - 5 = ?"  (simple borrow, one column)
     → Sub-steps: "Can you take 5 from 3? → Borrow → 13-5 = 8"
  
  2. "21 - 8 = ?"  
     → Sub-steps with visual blocks
  
  3. "42 - 17 = ?"  (the original error type)
     → Full sub-step guided walkthrough
  
  4. "53 - 29 = ?"
     → Sub-steps, user fills in each
  
  5. "71 - 45 = ?"
     → Minimal scaffolding

CHECK:
  5 questions of the form XX - YY where ones digit on top < ones digit on bottom.
  Must get 4/5 correct to proceed.
```

### A.2 Remediation: "Compensation Direction Reversed"

```
ILLUSTRATE:
  [Number line showing 45 + 28]
  "28 is close to 30. Let's add 30 instead — that's easier!"
  [Arrow: 45 → 75, labelled "+30"]
  "But wait — we added 2 too many (28→30 = +2 extra)"
  [Arrow: 75 → 73, labelled "-2"]
  "We added too much, so we SUBTRACT the extra. 45 + 28 = 73"
  
  [Second example: 63 - 29]
  "29 is close to 30. Let's subtract 30 instead."
  [Arrow: 63 → 33, labelled "-30"]
  "But we subtracted 1 too many (29→30 = 1 extra subtracted)"
  [Arrow: 33 → 34, labelled "+1"]
  "We subtracted too much, so we ADD back. 63 - 29 = 34"

EXPLAIN:
  "THE RULE: If you add too much → subtract the extra back.
   If you subtract too much → add the extra back.
   Think of it as 'undoing' the rounding."

GUIDED PRACTICE:
  1. "38 + 19 = ?"
     → "Round 19 to 20. How much extra? → 1"

## APPENDIX C: SUMMARY OF ALL METHODS WITH INTERMEDIATE STEPS

### Addition Methods Summary

| Method | Best For | Steps Shown |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Partitioning | General purpose | Split → Add each column → Recombine |
| Sequencing | One number simpler | Start → +hundreds → +tens → +ones |
| Compensation | Near-round numbers | Round → Easy calc → Adjust back |
| Column | Written fallback | Ones → Tens → Hundreds (with carries shown) |

### Subtraction Methods Summary

| Method | Best For | Steps Shown |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Partitioning | No borrowing needed | Split → Subtract each column → Recombine |
| Sequencing | Jump back method | Start → -hundreds → -tens → -ones |
| Compensation | Near-round subtrahend | Round → Easy calc → Adjust back |
| Same Difference | Make subtrahend round | Adjust both → Easy subtraction |
| Counting On | Close numbers | Count from smaller to larger, sum the jumps |
| Column | Written fallback | Ones → Tens → Hundreds (with borrows shown) |
